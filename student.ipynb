    "1. Runaway inflation, high interest rates, bank stress and tightening liquidity. This, compounded by fluctuating demand as a result of inflation income effect that is constraining consumer purchasing power, is having a negative toll on investment earnings in the area.\n",

Shifting population characteristics, such as age, income, and household composition, influence the types of properties in demand, preferred locations, and overall market trends e.g an aging population might lead to increased demand for retirement communities or homes with accessibility features.\n",
