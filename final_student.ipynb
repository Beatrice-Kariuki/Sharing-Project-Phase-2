    "\n",
    "1.Runaway inflation, high interest rates, bank stress and tightening liquidity. This, compounded by fluctuating demand as a\n",
    "result of inflation income effect that is constraining consumer purchasing power, is having a negative toll on investment earnings in the area.\n",

Shifting population characteristics, such as age, income, and household composition, influence the types of properties in demand, preferred locations, and overall market trends e.g an aging population might lead to increased demand for retirement communities or homes with accessibility features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key stakeholders who play a vital role in the real estate industry are ;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Real estate analysts - Help in providing valuable insights and analysis to support decision-making processes.\n",

    "Model evaluation metrics, including R-squared, MAE, and RMSE, provided a quantitative assessment of predictive accuracy. Model 2, with an R-squared value of 46.5%, outperformed the baseline model and demonstrated its ability to explain a substantial proportion of the variability in housing prices. The low MAE and RMSE values further indicated that the model's predictions were relatively close to the actual prices.\n",

    "However, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of the model. Real estate markets are dynamic, and various external factors can influence house prices, which might not be captured by the selected features. Continuous model refinement and updates with the latest data are crucial to maintaining accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, while the model met several assumptions of linear regression, addressing concerns such as heteroscedasticity, the complexity of the housing market suggests potential room for improvement. \n",

    "Future iterations of this project could explore alternative models, including polynomial regression, and consider incorporating additional localized features to enhance predictive capabilities.\n",

    "Overall, this project provides a foundation for predicting house prices in King County, offering valuable insights for real estate professionals, homeowners, and potential buyers. The continuous evolution and adaptation of the model will be key to ensuring its relevance and effectiveness in a dynamic real estate landscape."
